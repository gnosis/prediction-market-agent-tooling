    Calculate the optimal bet amount using the Kelly Criterion for a binary outcome market.

    From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion:

    f* = p - q / b

    where:
    - f* is the fraction of the current bankroll to wager
    - p is the probability of a win
    - q = 1-p is the probability of a loss
    - b is the proportion of the bet gained with a win

    Note: this calculation does not factor in that the bet changes the market
    odds. This means the calculation is only accurate if the bet size is small
    compared to the market volume. See discussion here for more detail:
